# Virtualfish Redux
This is a "redux" of the virtualfish project, remaking it from scratch and impementing new features.

## Why does this redux exist?
I wrote the original virtualfish in my first semester of my second year in college and I have since added many more tools to my toolbelt and want to fully bring forth the original idea I had for the project
