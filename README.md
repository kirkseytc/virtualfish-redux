# Virtualfish Redux
This is a "redux" of the virtualfish project, remaking it from scratch and impementing new features.

## Why does this redux exist?
I wrote the original virtualfish in my first semester of my second year in college and I have since added many more tools to my toolbelt and want to fully bring forth the original idea I had for the project

## Using virtualfish-redux
### Install
### Running
### Flags
|Flag|Argument|Description|
|----|---------|-----------|
|`-s`|`<seed>`|Seeds the randomizer to the amount passed in `<seed>`|
|`-c`|`<count>`|Sets the starting amount of fish to the amount passed in `<count>`|
|`-m`|`<max>`|Sets the max amount of fish possible to the amount passed in `<max>`|
|`-bw`|N/A|Starts in Black and White mode|
|`-nt`|N/A|Skips the title screen|

Example: 
Start with 5 fish, a max of 20 fish, and skip the title screen

`virtualfish -c 5 -m 20 -nt` 

~Note: the order of the flags don't matter.~
